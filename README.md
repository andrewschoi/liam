Installation

To install the real-time transcription service, please follow these steps:

    Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to install the service.

    Run the following command to install the service and its dependencies:

Once the installation is complete, you can start the service by running the following command:

The service should now be up and running. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Capturing Audio Stream

To capture an audio stream and begin transcribing, the user needs to click on the "start recording" button on the service's web interface. The user can then speak into their microphone, and the service will transcribe the audio in real-time.
Usage

Once the service is running, users can use the web interface to transcribe lectures, ask questions, and provide summaries. The service integrates with large language models to provide accurate transcriptions, and users can customize the service to meet their specific needs.
